# Math-it-Out
This repository was used for task tracking. The Cohere communications were integrated on Wix Velo.

## Inspiration

Our team is dedicated to helping individuals who struggle with math at all levels. We understand that math can be a challenging subject for many people, and that's why we've created a website to aid those who need extra support. Our website offers summaries and explanations of mathematical concepts, making it easier for individuals to understand and learn. Whether you're a student or an adult trying to improve your math skills, our website is here to help you succeed.

## What it does

Our software utilizes Cohere's advanced API to generate a supply of tailored math problems, catering to students of all grade levels. With its personalized learning options, you can take control of your education and tailor your experience to fit your needs. Not only that, but you can also challenge your friends to head-to-head competitions, track your progress on the leaderboard and even customize your avatar as you climb the ranks. Furthermore, teachers can create groups and adjust difficulty levels to suit the needs of their students, making it the perfect solution for both individual and classroom use. Additionally, we use SMS service to keep you informed and updated on your progress, making it easy to stay on track and reach your goals

## How we built it

Our website was built using the powerful programming language Python. We also employed the use of Cohere AI to provide advanced capabilities to our site. Our team of developers worked diligently to integrate Cohere AI into the Wix website, handling all the backend work to create a seamless and efficient user experience. The combination of Python and Cohere AI allowed us to create a website that is both functional and user-friendly, providing a unique and personalized experience for our users.

## Challenges we ran into

At the onset of our project, we encountered several limitations when utilizing Cohere AI. Specifically, we faced challenges with the generation of summaries, where the output often deviated significantly from the original prompt. Additionally, the text generation feature would sometimes include irrelevant content not present in the prompt. However, through extensive research and experimentation, we were able to overcome these obstacles and achieve the desired results

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are incredibly proud of the hard work and dedication our team has put in, despite the challenges of working remotely. The ability to collaborate effectively and efficiently in a virtual setting was a significant learning experience for us, and we are thrilled to have achieved a final product that we can be proud of

## What we learned

Our project has been a valuable learning experience for us, particularly in terms of the importance of clear and consistent communication, as well as the value of persistent and diligent work. Although it presented a challenge at times, we were able to work through it together by actively engaging in discussions and problem-solving. Additionally, as it was our first time working with AI, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of its capabilities and limitations, as well as the process of training and utilizing the technology to achieve specific outcomes.
